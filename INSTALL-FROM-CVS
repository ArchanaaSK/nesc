To build nesC from the CVS distribution, you need
automake 
autoconf 2.50 or later
emacs
gperf

Directions: in this directory
./Bootstrap (once only after checkout)
./configure TOSDIR=<location of your TinyOS tos directory>
  (note: if you don't specify TOSDIR, configure will try and find a directory
         named ../tos, then ../../tos, then $HOME/nest/tos before failing)
make

To install:
make install

To make a distribution that doesn't need the above tools:
make dist
or: make distdir=<your favourite name for the toplevel directory> dist
